## How we get our Data
The data pertaining to course information, instructors, and departments was acquired by querrying two foreign api endpoints.\ 
The queried endpoints belong to the following projects: <a href="https://www.boilergrades.com/" target="_blank">Boiler Grades</a> project and <a href="https://www.purdue.io/" target="_blank">Purdue.io</a>
The course data at Purdue remains fairly constant over time but in the case that there are changes to course data, the two apis that we use account for those changes.
