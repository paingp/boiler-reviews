## How we get our Data
The data pertaining to course information, instructors, and departments was acquired by querrying two foreign api endpoints.\
The queried endpoints belong to the following projects: <a href="https://www.boilergrades.com/" target="_blank">Boiler Grades</a> project and <a href="https://www.purdue.io/" target="_blank">Purdue.io</a>\
